<h1>"MY HOBBIES" </h1>
<h4><img src="drawing.gif" width="200"height="120" align="right"> One of my hobby is drawing because it allows me to express myself creatively and bring my imagination to life on paper. Drawing offers a therapeutic escape from the stresses of everyday life, enabling me to relax and focus on the present moment. Whether I’m sketching from observation, creating original characters, or experimenting with different techniques and mediums, drawing provides endless opportunities for growth and self-expression. Moreover, sharing my artwork with others and receiving feedback and encouragement from fellow artists is incredibly rewarding and motivates me to continue honing my skills. Overall, drawing is not just a hobby for me; it’s a passion that fuels my creativity and brings me joy with each stroke of the pencil.</h4>

<h4><img src="watching.gif" width="150"left="100" align="left"> I love watching animes too because it transports me to imaginative worlds filled with captivating stories, diverse characters, and visually stunning animation. It's a medium that offers a wide range of genres and themes, allowing me to explore different emotions, ideas, and perspectives. Anime has a unique ability to evoke strong emotions and spark my imagination, making each viewing experience memorable and rewarding. Additionally, the global anime community provides a sense of belonging and connection with others who share my passion, further enhancing my enjoyment of the medium. Overall, watching anime brings me joy, inspiration, and a sense of wonder that I can't find elsewhere.</h4>

<h4><img src="manga.jpg" width="150" left="100" align="right">i read mangas too because they offer a unique storytelling experience that complements anime and provides additional depth to the characters and plotlines. Mangas often delve into more detail than their anime counterparts, allowing me to immerse myself fully in the story and explore nuances that may not be captured on screen. Additionally, mangas cover a wide range of genres and themes, catering to different interests and moods. Whether I’m in the mood for action-packed battles, heartwarming romances, or suspenseful mysteries, there’s always a manga to suit my tastes. Furthermore, reading mangas allows me to support talented creators and discover hidden gems that may not have been adapted into anime yet. Overall, mangas are a valuable and enjoyable complement to my anime-watching hobby, offering endless entertainment and enriching my love for Japanese storytelling</h4>

<h2>Hello! I'm an enthusiastic student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, a field that captivates me with its endless possibilities and its power to transform the world. My academic life is a tapestry woven with threads of complex algorithms, innovative software solutions, and the robust architecture of networks that keep our digital world pulsing.</h2>

<h2><img src="football.jpeg" width ="200" height ="150" align ="right" alt="football picture" >Parallel to my academic pursuits, I am an athlete with a fervent passion for football. The green field is my canvas, and the ball is my brush with which I paint moments of agility, strategy, and teamwork. Football is not just a game for me; it's a metaphor for life, where every goal scored is a triumph over challenges, and every miss is a lesson learned.</h2>

<h2><img src="biking.jpeg"width ="200" height="200" align ="left" alt="biking picture">When I'm not decoding problems or scoring goals, you'll find me cycling. It's more than a hobby; it's a journey on two wheels that takes me through the highs and lows of terrains, much like the ebbs and flows of life. As I pedal, I'm often accompanied by music, the universal language that speaks directly to the soul. It's a symphony that harmonizes with the rhythm of my ride, creating a perfect balance between motion and emotion.</h2>

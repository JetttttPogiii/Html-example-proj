  <h1>"MY FAVORITE COLOR" </h1>
  <h2><p><em><b><img src="Sky.jpg"width="150" height ="120" align="left"alt="Sky picture" >The color blue resonates with me deeply. It's the hue of the sky and the ocean, vast and infinite, much like the potential I see in technology and sports. It's a color that calms the spirit and ignites the imagination, reflecting my own tranquil yet ambitious nature.</b></em></p></h2>

  <h1>"MY FAVORITE FOOD" </h1>
  <h2><p><em><b><img src="BicolExpress.jpeg" width="150" height ="100"align="left">My palate craves the fiery zest of Bicol Express, a dish that mirrors my own inclination for intensity and flavor.

  <h2>In essence, my life is a blend of technology, sports, and the simple pleasures that bring joy and color to my days. Each aspect of my life fuels the other, creating a dynamic balance that propels me forward. Whether I'm troubleshooting a network, scoring a goal, or simply enjoying the world on my bike, I'm always moving towards becoming a better version of myself, one step, one pedal, and one code at a time.</h2>
